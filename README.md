# FarmGood

### Concept:

Project FarmGood is aimed to favour the educated and modern agriculturists to practice agriculture efficiently. This is done by suggesting to them what they can do with the piece of land that they plan to work on.

This can be brought into reality with the help of AI, which we plan to train with all the agricultural data we could find on public websites and forums. We take info from our clients such as how much land they plan to work in, How fertile the land is, Where is the field exactly is, etc. We take environmental factors into account the weather and climate that we collect from the specified location and fertility data provided by them. At last, AI suggests to them which cropping would be most beneficial to plant. We also advise them to do so at their own risk.

### Daily plan:
- Day 1: Ideated and came up with the ideas.
- Day 2: thought further and came up with features that would make the application stand out. Got review by Rutuj and Arnab. Did a little bit more thinking and came up with a better structure.
- Day 3: Going to start working on the low fid design using Figma. Finalise the parts that is my main focus and start to work on them.
- Day 4: Going to continue working on the low-fid design and if the low-fid design finishes then I will start working on the high-fid design.
- Day 5: Going to start working on the High-fid design.
- Day 6: In parallel with the High-fid design continue working on the actual project by creating a new Git-Hub project and start with initialisation of frontend and backend of project.

Forwardâ€¦ : yet to be planned.
